## **Story: Plague Doctor**

It was a cold morning. The year was 1670. A dark figure move silently through the trees, nearing a village that had been infected with the black plague. No one knew who he was as he hide his identity, by wearing a black robe and a white mask that would soon be part of his physical body forever. People knew nothing about him then and thought that he would be the hero that would save everyone from the disease. However, they would soon realise that he would kill everyone in the village who had the disease just with a single touch. He would never be seen until a few centuries later.

Fats forward to the 20th century where the same figure had been found in a town in France with dead corpes that have seemed to be tested on.
