## **Story: Plague Doctor**

Origin

It was a cold morning. The year was 1670. A dark figure move silently through the trees, nearing a village that had been infected with the black plague. No one knew who he was as he hide his identity, by wearing a black robe and a white mask that would soon be part of his physical body forever. People knew nothing about him then and thought that he would be the hero that would save everyone from the disease. However, they would soon realise that he would kill everyone in the village who had the disease just with a single touch. He would never be seen until a few centuries later.

Second Discovery

Fast forward to the 20th century where the same figure had been found in a town in France with dead corpes that have seemed to be tested on. Upon finding him, special forces were called to take the plague doctor away to a place where he would stay forever, the SCP foundation. Suprisingly, the plague doctor made very little attempt to escape and was very cooperation with the guards that had came to take him away.

Classification

The plague doctor was classified as a euclid class object, which means that his behaviour cannot be predicted as it behaves outside of current scientific knowledge and its nature is simply poorly understood at present. He was also called SCP-049.

Behaviour 

After killing those who the plague doctor comes into contact with, SCP-049 then somehow produces a black bag filled with medical and surgical tools, then begins surgery on the victim, inserting several unknown chemicals into the corpse. After a few minutes, the corpse will come back to life and is an instance of SCP-049-2. It behaves aggressively and will wander until it encouters another human. It will then kill the human and go back to its mindless state.
